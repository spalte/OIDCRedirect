# OIDC Redirect

OIDC Redirect is a small Node.js server that allows [OHIF](https://ohif.org), or other OIDC enabled apps, running on a host that has already been authenticated by some other means (ie. local login, VM displayed only to an authenticated user, etc.) to immediately connect to a Google Cloud Healthcare PACS. OIDC Redirect will use environment variables to determine the logged-in user.

The server is meant to be run and bound to the loopback address (127.0.0.1) of the authenticated host. The server will blindly return tokens to any callers.

The server could be made accessible only to a specific subnet in order to allow access for all users on that subnet.

Authentication with Google can be accomplished by either passing an OAuth2 refresh_token along with an id_token and client_secret, or can be set up by directly using a Service Account using a Google credential file in JSON format.

## Running with Docker-Compose

Run:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build the OIDC Redirect image and launch it (port 8085) along with OHIF (port 3000).

Once launched you should be able to open OHIF locally.

```url
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

OHIF will open and initiate an OIDC flow with the OIDC Redirect server and connect to the open `server.dcmjs.org` DICOMweb server as directed in the `app-config.js` configuration file. If you inspect the network connection though, you will note that an `Authorization` HTTP header has been added (default "default_access_token"). In order to point to a Google Cloud Healthcare PACS, modify WADO-RS URIs in the app-config.js file that is passed to OHIF.

## Environment variables

`LOGGED_IN_USER_SUB` *Optional* Overwrites the `sub` claim in the returned `id_token` and responses to `userinfo` and `introspect`.

`LOGGED_IN_USER_NAME` *Optional* Overwrites the `name` claim in the returned `id_token` and responses to `userinfo` and `introspect`.

`LOGGED_IN_USER_EMAIL` *Optional* Overwrites the `email` claim in the returned `id_token` and responses to `userinfo` and `introspect`.

`ISSUER` *Optional* Can be set to specify at what URL the service will be running (ex. `http://127.0.0.1:8085`). By default an attempt will be made to derive the issuer from the request.

`LISTEN_PORT` *Optional* Can be used to set what port will be used. Default is 8080.

`LISTEN_ADDRESS` *Optional* IP address to bind. Set to the unspecified address (`0.0.0.0`) to bind all addresses. Default is `127.0.0.1`. The Docker image default is `0.0.0.0`.

`SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` *Optional* Can be specified to provide the key the server will use to sign the returned `id_token`. If this is not specified, a new private key will be generated at startup. The commented out values in the `docker-compose.yml` rely on the presence of a file that must be created and named, `server_private_key.pem`.

If `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL_FILE` is defined, an Access Token acquired from Google for that service account will be returned. This variable should point to a Google Service account credential file in JSON format. The commented out values in the `docker-compose.yml` rely on the presence of a file that must be created and named `service-account.json`.

Alternatively, if `GOOGLE_ID_TOKEN_FILE`, `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN_FILE`, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` are defined, an Access Token obtained by using the refresh token will be returned. The commented out values in the `docker-compose.yml` rely on the presence of files that must be created and named `google_id_token.txt`, `google_refresh_token.txt`, and `google_client_secret.txt`.

`SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY` Can be used to specify the server private key directly.

`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL` Can be used to specify the service account credential JSON object directly.

`GOOGLE_ID_TOKEN` Can be used to specify the Google id_token directly.

`GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` Can be used to specify the Google refresh_token directly.

`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` Can be used to specify the Google client secret directly.

## Manually obtaining a refresh_token and an id_token

The following steps can be followed in order to manually obtain a Google refresh_token and id_token.

Create an [OAuth 2.0 Client ID](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). Once the Client ID is created, replace the variables in the following URL and point a web browser to it. It may be helpful to have the browser debugger open if the return_uri does not point to a real web site.

```URL
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?scope=openid%20email%20profile%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcloud-platform&response_type=code&state=12345&prompt=consent&access_type=offline&client_id=$(client_id)&redirect_uri=$(urlencoded_redirect_uri)
```

Follow the login process, and collect the code in the url once redirected. Replace the variables in the following shell command, and execute it.

```shell
curl -H "Origin: $(allowed_origin)" "https://$(client_id):$(client_secret)@oauth2.googleapis.com/token" -d grant_type=authorization_code -d redirect_uri=$(urlencoded_redirect_uri) -d code=$(code)
```
